In front of the mirror he stands,
The narcissistic boy,
A sight to behold,
A vain and egotistical ploy.

His eyes, they sparkle like diamonds,
His smile, it shines so bright,
He's the most handsome in the land,
A true beacon of light.

He admires his chiseled features,
His flawless complexion too,
He's the epitome of perfection,
The world should look up to.

With a twirl and a flex,
He poses for the camera,
Captivating all who behold him,
He's the envy of the drama.

He praises his own intelligence,
And his exceptional wit,
His skills are second to none,
He's a true master of his craft.

He boasts of his athletic prowess,
And his many accomplishments too,
He's a man of many talents,
A rare breed, it's true.

The narcissistic boy loves himself,
And he loves to bask in his glory,
The world revolves around him,
That's his self-indulgent story.

But in his heart, there's a void,
A sense of emptiness deep within,
For all his wealth and beauty,
He's still searching for his kin.

For the world doesn't revolve around him,
And he's not the center of it all,
True happiness comes from within,
And his narcissism, it's bound to fall.

So let him bask in his own glory,
And revel in his vanity,
For in the end, it's his own heart,
That will reveal the true reality.
